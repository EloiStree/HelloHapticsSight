# Hello Haptics Sight

**The Question:** Can we see with vibration data from a game, or Quest 3 telemetry?

**Sponsor Notification:**

I am a teacher in XR and I have asked the company bHaptics for a suit with the aim of experimenting with the ability to give blind people game input feedback. I am creating telemetry from *World of Warcraft* by using color and want to combine the two.

They have agreed to let me experiment and sent me the product.  
As we have access to the Quest 3 camera since February 2025, if it works in-game, it could work in real life.  

If you know someone who is blind, around Belgium, and wants to experiment with playing *World of Warcraft* (or another game) using the bHaptics suit, contact me on Discord: [Join Discord](https://discord.gg/uKwNN2ECJH)

**This Git:**
Just a repository where I take note on my learning of the devices: API, Manual, Code, Links, Software.
